Answer the following questions:

1. What is the rule for underlining text that is not a link?
    You shouldn't underlink any text that isn't a link. Can be confusing.

2. How should the unvisited link color compare to the visited link color in terms of:
  1. Brightness - unvisited sites should be bright
  2. Hue - unvisted sites should be vivid
  3. Visibility to color-blind users - put in redundant cues for those with color-blindness by making visited sites dull and unvisited bright

3. What is a "perceived affordance"? Hint: Google is your friend. (OK, not really, but the search is nice.)
  Perceived affordance is the quality of an object that suggests how it might be used. In screen based communications, the concept of perceived affordance is useful when designing or evaluating a graphic user interface (GUI).

4. When can you safely eliminate underlines for links?
    Underlines are not required if the link displays bright for unvisited and dull for visited link.

5. Should you use blue for text? Why or why not?
    Try not to use color for text that can be confused for a link.  Link colors can be any color but are more often shown in blue. Don't use blue text for non-link words.

6. If for some shocking reason, your contextual links are not underlined (horrors!), what can you do to improve link discovery by users?
    Make the color dull for visited sites.  Hovering affect for link titles to display when the curser hovers over the link.

7. What are link titles and how might you use them?
    Link titles display the link when the curser hovers over the link - you can do this hover and it will display where the link goes.
