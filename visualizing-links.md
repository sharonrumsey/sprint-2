3. What is a "perceived affordance"? Hint: Google is your friend. (OK, not really, but the search is nice.)
4. When can you safely eliminate underlines for links?
5. Should you use blue for text? Why or why not?
6. If for some shocking reason, your contextual links are not underlined (horrors!), what can you do to improve link discovery by users?
