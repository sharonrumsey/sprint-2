  1. What social capital is - "social capital: the trust, knowledge, reciprocity and shared norms that create quality of life and make a group resilient."

  --The groups that surfaced more and better solutions shared three key qualities. First, they gave one another roughly equal time to talk. This wasnâ€™t monitored or regulated, but no one in these high-achieving groups dominated or was a passenger. Everyone contributed and nothing any one person said was wasted.
  --The second quality of the successful groups was social sensitivity: these individuals were more tuned in to one another, to subtle shifts in mood and demeanor.
  --And the third distinguishing feature was that the best groups included more women, perhaps because that made them more diverse, or because women tend to score more highly on tests for empathy. 

  2. How important do you think trust and empathy are to your success in life?

  Empathy creates understanding and opens your mind to see others in an open way and not in a judgemental way.  Understanding that empathy needs to be both ways as an interaction.  Trust comes through empathy - those that are judgement are more fearful and will find it harder to trust.
