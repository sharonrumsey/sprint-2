  1. What social capital is - "social capital: the trust, knowledge, reciprocity and shared norms that create quality of life and make a group resilient."

  --The groups that surfaced more and better solutions shared three key qualities. First, they gave one another roughly equal time to talk. This wasnâ€™t monitored or regulated, but no one in these high-achieving groups dominated or was a passenger. Everyone contributed and nothing any one person said was wasted.
  --The second quality of the successful groups was social sensitivity: these individuals were more tuned in to one another, to subtle shifts in mood and demeanor.
  --nd the third distinguishing feature was that the best groups included more women, perhaps because that made them more diverse, or because women tend to score more highly on tests for empathy.
