Using the contrast checker, determine whether each of the following combinations meets or fails the color contrast test foreground/background) for small or large text:

1. #f0e68c / #fffacd - failed
2. #f08080 / #fffacd - failed
3. #778899 / #f5fffa - failed
4. #b0e0e6 / #191970 - passed
5. #ffff00 / #000000 - passed
6. #98fb98 / #ff4500 - failed
7. #800080 / #da70d6 - failed

Were you surprised by any of these?
--Not really - it was hard to read the ones that failed or they were just difficult to make out the wording.  The second one that passed was a bit harsh to look at though.
