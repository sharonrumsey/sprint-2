Add your reflections on Scrum

I really like the aspect that the end user can have input during phases of the build.  With the old method it seemed like end users simply had to live with the finished product and if the brief wasn't communicated properly then the finished product wouldn't match expectations.

It would be great working on a team toward a goal and have broken down assignments with completion dates.  It may be harder for some individuals to work within this process.
