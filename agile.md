Add your reflections on Scrum

NOTES: Agile development is based on iterative incremental development and is a theoretical framework and doesn't specify the approach the development team should follow.  Scrum is a specific agile process framework that defines the practices required to be followed.

--What interests you?
I really like the aspect that the end user can have input during phases of the build.  With the old method it seemed like end users simply had to live with the finished product and if the brief wasn't communicated properly then the finished product wouldn't match expectations.

It would be great working on a team toward a goal and have broken down assignments with completion dates.  I actually think I would like the job of Product Owner or SCRUM Master (or should that be Mistress?).


--What confuses you?
What the beginning looks like? How it is started? The "stories" seem to be narratives from front end users - would really like to see examples and how best to organize and prioritize.  

Add your reflections on Pairing

--What interests you?
Pairing sounds like a social approach and is interesting to me since I like to work as a member of a team.  

--What confuses you?
More what would make it difficult for me is keeping clear on each role as you are doing them.  Driver is typing and Navigator guides in the right direction.  It would be hard for me not to type while navigating and difficult to type with someone watching me do so as the driver.
