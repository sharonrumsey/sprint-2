Add your reflections on the principles of User Center Design

1.  Which principles seem most important to you?
    Make it simple and familiar.  If the front end user has less stress and feels comfortable with the function of the design then you have given the user the confidence to work within the design.

    Also the elimination of "key stroke" or human errors can be very important especially if the data you are collecting is for acredited systems or are very sensitive and may be required as proof of evidence against accusations of non-compliance.

2.  Are there any with which you disagree or feel are unimportant or less important?
    Reduce the mental effort - needs to be balanced with the user going into "automatic drive" - like driving your car home and after arriving then realizing you weren't paying as much attention as you should and just doing it out of habit.  So, the user needs to have catches in place to make sure that processes are habitual when they need more thought.

3.  Are there any which surprised you?
    No - none of them surprised me.  I think I would add that documentation should be intuitive for the user and short and sweet and to the point - and always up-to-date.  There will always be a user that will start out and require the reassurance of reading and seeing pictures that tell them they are taking the correct steps.

1. What surprised you?
    I'm actually not that surprised by how many projects are eventually rejected due to poor design to brief.  I can understand how difficult it can be to communicate to some programmers/coders - many which are diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome.  Communicating with them can be difficult in just a general daily living of life.  To communicate with them on a many layered and complex process of "the brief of what they need the program to do" for front end users can be a fractured affair.  From my experience you'll feel like you are talking about the same thing but when the final results occurs it was obviously not true.

2. Does this change your view of web and software development?
    I'm glad that there is promotion to change the process and I've always wondered in my own mind of ways of solving this problem.  Communicating the brief is not a simple affair and can't easily be accomplished in a few short meetings.  People evolve their conversations so it's obvious that the initial brief should not be written in stone - but the priorties should be worked on first.  Just being clear what these priorties are are difficult enough.
