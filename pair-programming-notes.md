Pick a classmate and try doing some pair programming on your HTML or JS this week.  Record your observations and thoughts in this document.

Did pair programming with @Toby - session consisted of remote "Ping Pong" session that last for 1 hour.

We wrote mostly wrote in html/css and discussed how challenged we were from learning JavaScript on the FreeCodeCamp site.  

After reading Corey Haines thoughts on pair programming I realized that Toby and I worked in the Ping Pong Pairing using Cloud9 and speaking to each other in appear.in.  Worked well and the session went quickly.  

Happy first experience.
