1. Log your reflections on:

  1. What do you think?
  It's good to make the effort and to apply gender neutral language.  

  2. Do you make an effort to use gender neutral language?

  After reading information about the SCRUM I wonder why one titled role is called "Scrum Master"?  Not very gender neutral language.  I understand the need to promote gender neutral speech and I agree that we can do more to promote equality so that we aren't implying that only one gender is capable of work positions or roles in daily lives.  I will do my best to do more to incorporate gender neutral speech.

  3. What do you think when you hear non-gender-neutral language?

  I hear it so often I'm sort of immune to it and admit that I'm not reactive to it.  I think when you do your own part to correct your speech toward gender neutral references it then teaches others through daily conversations.
